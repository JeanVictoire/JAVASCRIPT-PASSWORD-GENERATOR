# PASSWORD GENERATOR

This week’s Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated JavaScript code.

When you click the button to generate a password you are ask the for the length of the password,then you choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
When asked for character types to include in the password,then you can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
When you answer each prompt,then your input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected,then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
When the password is generated, you will see the password display on the page.
